Data files generated by the 'test_json_repo' module will be placed in this directory.

If you encounter an error during testing advising you to 'check and delete' files in this directory, testing can usually be resumed by deleting all files with names starting with 'test' and ending with 'json'.

Please avoid placing any other files in this directory, as such files may run the risk of getting accidentally overwritten or deleted.
