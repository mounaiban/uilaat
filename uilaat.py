    Only the first code point of the character can be modified, while

# Important Information
# ---------------------
#
# Substitution Points (SP's)
# ==========================
# SPs are intended to be a platform-agnostic method of including
# characters matched by a dictionary key or regular expression into the
# default translation output. They are indicated by U+FFFC.
# (See also: Unicode Standard, Section 23.8)
#
# In an example default substitution:
#
# dict: {'':'\ufffc\u2e04'}
# code points: U+FFFC + U+2E04
# input: 'J'
# output: 'J' + U+2E04
#
# Function Format and Usage
# =========================
# Substitution functions accept a single argument like: f(x)
# The scope of a function determines what is accepted for the argument.
# There are currently only three scopes:
# 
#   * Character - the function takes a character (a one-character str 
#       in Python) and returns its replacement.
#
#   * String - the function takes an entire string and outputs a
#       another version with the subsitutions.
#
#   * NOP - do not use the function (this is used for toggling functions
#       temporarily during runtime)
#
# A function can only be of one scope at any given time.
#
# Multi-Substitution function lists contain tuples that are formatted as
# follows: (function, scope, meta_dict)
#
# The scope is implemented as a str, supported scopes are found near
# the top of this file. The meta_dict is a dict-like object which
# contains additional information for a user's application.
#
# Functions are applied in the same order as they appear in the list.
#
