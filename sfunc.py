    Create a Code Point Value Arithmetic substitution function.

    subtraction.

    This function has character scope.

    Arguments
    ---------
    * r_start - (int) the beginning of the code point range to which
        the replacement applies

    * r_end - (int) the last code point in the code point range to
        which the replacement applies

    * offset - (int) the value to add to or subtract from for an
        affected code point; use a negative int for subtraction

    Limitations
    -----------
    Handling of multi-code point characters is currently rather basic.
    Only the first code point of the character can be modified, while
    the other code points are copied unmodified.

    Arguments

        substitutions. Characters not targeted by the dictionary are
        copied over unchanged.

    Limitations

    Multi-code point characters and Multi-character targets are currenly
    not supported. However, multi-code point or multi-character

    Create a Regular Expression (RE) function.

    pattern, multi-character and multi-code point targets are fully
    supported.

    This function has string scope.

    Arguments
    ---------
    * re_str - (str) a string representation of an RE, for
        information on RE syntax, see the Python Standard Library
        documentation on Regular Expressions:
        https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html

        by re_str

    Limitations
    -----------
    Regular expressions can be slow and computationally expensive.
    Please use this type of function sparingly.

    As there is no single standard for REs, the Perl-Compatible Regular
    Expressions (PCRE) standard is preferred for compatibility with
    other implementations of UILAAT. Please be aware that the level of
    support for PCRE can vary widely between platforms.

# Function Format and Usage
# =========================
# NOTE: The current Functions (sfunc_from_covar, sfunc_from_dict,
# sfunc_from_re, sfunc_from_list) are being *deprecated* for upcoming
# functions that more closely resemble functional programming.
#
# Substitution functions accept a single argument like: f(x)
# The scope of a function determines what is accepted for the argument.
# There are currently only three scopes:
#
#   * Character - the function takes a character (a one-character str
#       in Python) and returns its replacement.
#
#   * String - the function takes an entire string and outputs a
#       another version with the subsitutions.
#
#   * NOP - do not use the function (this is used for toggling functions
#       temporarily during runtime)
#
# A function can only be of one scope at any given time.
#
# Multi-Substitution function lists contain tuples that are formatted as
# follows: (function, scope, meta_dict)
#
# The scope is implemented as a str, supported scopes are found near
# the top of this file. The meta_dict is a dict-like object which
# contains additional information for a user's application.
#
# Functions are applied in the same order as they appear in the list.
